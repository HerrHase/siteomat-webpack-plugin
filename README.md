# happy-site-webpack-plugin

**In Development**

A Webpack Plugin to generate a Website from a hierarchical Markdown file structure.

Why? The Main reason i had to update some Websites, but realise there were no benfit
to use a Full CMS or Headless CMS like Directus. Rendering the same pages that a rarley updated
seems like a waste of energy. Why not generate from a hierachical file structure. Luckly i
i had development a CMS that runs on Markdown File a few years ago as a proof of concept.
