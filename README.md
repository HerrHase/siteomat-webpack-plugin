# happy-site-webpack-plugin

**In Development**

A Webpack Plugin to generate a Website from a hierarchical Markdown file structure.

Why? The Main reason i had to update some Websites, but realise there was not benfit
to use a Full CMS or Headless CMS like Directus. And also the waste a loot of
energy by rendering the same sites that rarley have been updated. Why not generate
from a hierachical file structure. A few Years ago i have build a small CMS that runs
with Markdown Files.

What about Functions like Comments? A lot of Sites use pure html-Files and run
Micorservices for all the other Stuff. That is no possible for all Use-Cases, but there
some who will benfit from this Concept.
